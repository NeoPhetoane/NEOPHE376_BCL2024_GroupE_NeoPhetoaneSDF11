**Project summary**

The project included is a landing page for Cache bank. The bank offers easily accessible banking catered specifically to software developers. The page is meant to visually appeal to developers, advertise the efficiency and reliability of the bank and prompt the visitor to register with and interact with them.

**Reflections**

The main structures used in the making of the landing page is html, CSS, Tailwind and JavaScript. Aside from making a visually appealing site fir visitors, another main point of this page was for it to be fully responsive to accommodate a larger audience. From the visual aspect, margin for spacing between elements is used, padding for spacing within an element. Grid to order components such as the cards in aa easily digestible layout and flexbox to allow easy styling and distribution of space and content while allowing responsiveness. On the side of responsive design, flexbox containers, as mentioned ubove play an integral role. The concept of mobile first also helps in specifying which layout belongs to which screen.

**Areas of Mastery**

**Nesting**: I have eventually understood the concept of nesting elements inside others so that the parents' characteristics can apply to the children. And I have understood the importance of where one closes their tags and the significance of it to the overall layout.

**Media-first concept:** I understand that when coding, you are able to create a design that is most suitable for small screens and then work your way up to the larger screens. This increases accessibility as phones are mostly used than other devices.

**Tags and their functions**: I clearly understand which tags to use for which function. For example, the (span) tag is used to select a specific section of the code, the anchor (a) tag is used to direct the user to a link and the (div) tag is used to group sets of elements.

**Challenges faced**

**Tags**: The reason I was able to be confident with using tags is that they cause most bugs while coding. At some point the image inside a container, in the "getting started' section, would not move with the container. The bug was a closed div tag that was never opened. Essentially, my issue was keeping up with many tags.

**Responsiveness:** The use of margin and padding confused me when using a container. With buttons, the effect is more obvious but when using containers I would change the wrong property and thus affect the page instead of the specific container.

**Areas of Improvement**

**The drop down menu:** I still need to know how to make it close when the page is opened because it opens automatically when in mobile view.

**Pictures in Containers:** The images are cut off and I spent hours trying to debug them but they are still the same.

**Conclusion**

Building a landing page for Cache bank was an eye opening, stressful and exciting experience. It brought all of the knowledge acquired so far into practice and enabled clearer understanding and the bugs were frustrating learning curbs. Overall the project showed that practice improves understanding.
